Biba Integrity Model
	- various models dealing with integrity
		- high, medium, low
	- Strict integrity policy:
	- inverse/dual of BLP model
		1. s c S can read o O iff i(s) < i(o)
		2. s c S can read o O iff i(o) <= i(s)
		2. s1 c S can read s2 c S iff i(s2) <= i(s1)

Intuition for integrity levels
	- the higher the level, the more confidence:
		- that a program will exe correctly
		- that the data is accurate and/or reliable
	- Note relatioship between integrity and trutworthiness
	- important point: integrity levels are not confidentiality levels

Can you run BLP and BIBA at the same time? Yes.
	- how much integrity and how confidentiality
	- system can write to higher intnegrity/lower
	- not compplex when you get it

NIST (National institute of Standard Technology) Framework for Cybersecurity
	- Cybersecurity Framework
		- Includes a set of standards, methodologies, procedures and process that align policy, business, and tech approaches to address cyber risk
		- provide a prioritized, fexable, repeatable, performance based, cost effective approach including info security measures and controls to help owners and operators of critical infrastructire, identify, assess, and manage cyber attacks
	- The framework is for Organizaitons
		- of any size in any secture
		- already have a mature cyber risk mgt system
		- dont have cyber risk mgt system
		- anyone
	- continued improvement of critical infrastructure cybersecurity
	- Framework consist of 3 big pieces
		- Framework profile if you say you are who say you are
	- Framework core
		- High level version of the framework core
		- this is what the project is on
	- Framework Implementation
		- policy and how it should be implemented

NIST Framework Core
	- What processes and assets need protection?
		- asset management, biz envirmn, governace, risk assessment, risk mgt strats
	- What safeguards are available?
		- access control, awareness adn training, data security, info prot process & procedures, maintence, protective tech
	- What techniques can identify incidents?
		- anomolies and events, security continuous monitoriung, detection processes
	- What techniques can contain impacts of incidents?
		- response planning, communication, analysis, mitigation, improvements
	- What techniques can restore capabilities?
		- recovery planning, improvements, comms

Key Attributes
	- Its a framework, not a prescriptive standard
		- provides a common language and systematic methodology for managing cyber risk
		- is meant to be adapted
		- does not tell an org how much cyber risk is tolerable, nor provide "one and only formula"
		- enable best practives
	- Its voluntary
	- Its a living Document

Common Patterns of Use
	- Integrate the funcitons into your leadership vocab and mgt tool sets
	- Determine optimal risk mgt using implementation tiers
	- measure current risk mgt using implemenetaiton tiersr
	- reflect on biz env, governace, and risk mgt strat categories
	- develop a profile of cyber securitiy proprities leverging (sub)sector profiles when available

Key Concepts
	- Core set of CS Concepts
		- identify protect detect respond recover
	- any strong cs plan must address all
		- cant secure what you cant ident
		- cant provide perf protection
		- can ponly respond if youre aware an isuse
		- key objective is not prevent any possible attack but instead to have identified risk, deployed counter measures based on risks, and have plans to recover.

Jeep Chreokee hack
	- uconnect, connected computer with the stereo dash
			- break into the cell network in the car
			- get the CAM messages which control wipers, AC, radio, brakes, acceleromteter, etc.
	- Chrysler fialed to identify all the pieces and detect wtf to do if commands come from Uconnect
	- Cars now have intrusion detections

Menlo Report - what are the rules?
	- What are the rules for cybersecurity
	- Respect for persons - make sure subject is voluntary
	- Beneficence - Do not harm
	- Justice - each person deserves equal consideration in how to be treated
	- Respect for law and public interest - let the org know you found a vulnerability
