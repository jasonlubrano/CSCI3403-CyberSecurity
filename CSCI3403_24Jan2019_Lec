Motivatin Problems:
	- Confidentiality: how could we encrpt a message? (Email, web/http, sms, etc)
	- integrity: How could we authenticate a message?
	- availability: ?

Cryptography
	- Classified along three independent dimensions
		- the type of ops used for transforming plain to cipher text
		- number of keys used
		- the way in which plaintext is processed

Symmertric Encryption
	- the universal technique for providing confidentiality ofr transmitted or storeddata
	- also referred to as conventional encryption or single-key encryption

Classical Symmetric Cryptography
	- classical substitution cipher: caesar cipher
	- change characteris in planetetx to produce ciphertext
		- pick a key: a letter from a-z
		- equivalently pick a number from 0-25
		- encrypt by adding key to each letter in plaintext
	- example
		- key D or eq 3
		- shift each letter forward by 3, wrap around x geos to A
		- plaintext is HELLO WORLD
		- Cipertext is KHOOR ZRUOG

Formal Definiton of Caesar Ciper
	- Quintuple(E, D, M, K, C)
	- M set of plaintext
	- K set of keys
	- C sets of cipher texts
	- E set of encryption functions e: M x K -> C
	- D set of decryption functions d: C x K -> M

Attacking the Caesar cipher
	- Brute force/exhaustive search
		- simply try all keys until you find the correct one
		- decrypt using each key and consider whether it produces a valid plaintext message
		- caesar cipher only has 26 possible keys
	- Known plaintext attack
		- adversary has cipher text and corresponding plaintext
		- recover the key presumaly to decrypt future messages
		- example: know ciphertext is KHOOR ZRUOG and know plaintext is HELLO WORLD
